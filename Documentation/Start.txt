Hello,
------

You may want to start on sea.

To get it:
 1 Choose a specific predifined Airport which has an equivalent Moorage place (look at the PBY-Catalina/Mooring/mooring-pos_boeing314-based.xml)
 2 run fgfs
 3 Set the property /sim/mooring to true, that is, add the property to your launcher as

       --prop:/sim/mooring=true

for instance

       fgfs --airport=KSFO --aircraft=PBY-5A --prop:/sim/mooring=true
 
the Aircraft will be floating at the original Seaplane Harbour place close to KSFO Airport

<b>Without the property, the aircraft will be started, properly set in the runway</b>

       fgfs --airport=KSFO --aircraft=PBY-5A

Or, If you want to disable that moorage explicitly, run per example,

      fgfs --airport=KSFO --aircraft=PBY-5A --prop:/sim/mooring=false

Enjoy!

***

<b>The behavior for the start up was modified by the USA Tour consortium, February 2016, to enable the usage of lat, lon, heading keypairs, and mooring, example</b>

     fgfs --aircraft=PBY-5A --lat=0 --lon=0 --heading=0 --prop:/sim/mooring=true

Will now behave as expect.
