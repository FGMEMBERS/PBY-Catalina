HOW TO START THE AIRCRAFT


The model start with the engines stopped.

 the how to start is explained  on the GUI "Menu/Help/Aircraft Help"
 
 
 
 MOORING
 
 It is a Seaplane, so i have included the  mooring feature which is part of the  wonderful model  seaplane Boeing314
 
To start from an airport which has a close mooring place, situate the Seaplane  automatically on that place, with landing gear UP and Floats DOWN.
 
 For exemple KSFO which has a mooring place on the San Fransisco Bay near Bay Bridge.
 Or LFML (Marseilles Marignane) has a mooring place on the Etang de Berre.
 
 The Cables which hold the aircraft in place, are simulated, with the "Brake Parking" feature
