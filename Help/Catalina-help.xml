                =========================================
                That Model is the Catalina  PBY6 converted to be a water bomber
                It was in use in the south-east of France from 1964 to 1970
                =========================================

            START and STOP ROUTINE
            To start the engines
            =>increase magneto switch  and electric master switch "on" ( key  name "}")
            => start engines ( key   "space" or "s" of you have a recent FlightGear version)
            then take off

            To take off
            =>Unlock Brake parking  (shift B)
            =>Push the throttle to maximum
            When speed 70 knots pull the stick
            The aircraft will take off

            To stop the engines
            =>decrease magneto switch  and electric master switch "off" ( key  name "{")

            WATER BOMBER
            You mays simulate  the filling of the water tank ( 4000 liters)
            when
                =>on the water, you want the floats DOWN  (key"f")
                =>prepare the filling (command key  "L")
                => a speed minimum of 55 kts
            The filling duration time is 100 sec.
            Control your speed which must be more than 55 kts  (if less it does not fill)
            More is better, you may slide over the water touching it at 90 kts
            When loading,  the aircraft is getting more and more heavy.
            When loaded  the weight of the aircraft is heavier of 4000 kg , remember it when taking off
            After take off don't forget, you want the floats UP (key"f")

            Now you may simulate a water bombing
                => At a low agl, (let's say 200 ft) and over the target which is supposed to be bombed,
                => release the water (command key 'l" like "l"etter)
            The water can be seen falling down.

            The  aircraft is right now 4000 kg less , it will suddenly jump upper in the sky, be prepared for it.

            You may again, go back on the sea  and fill again, that process is repeatable as long as you wish it.
