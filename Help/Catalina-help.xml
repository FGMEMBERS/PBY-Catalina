This Catalina  PBY6 was converted to be a water bomber and used in the south-east of France from 1964 to 1970

Engine start:
- Magneto on ( }} )
- Start engine ( s )

Take off:
- Release parking brake (Shift-B)
- Full Throttle
- Take off at 70kts

Engine Stop:
- Magneto off ( {{ )
- Engine master Off

Water Bombing - Filling:
- Floats down ( f )
- Prepare for filling ( L )
- Minimum speed 45kts

Filling duration is 100 seconds. The tanks will only fill above 45kts. Faster is better - you can skim along the water at 80kts.

Note that during loading, the aircraft increases in weight significantly (4000kg!). Bear this in mind on taking off.

Once filled up and in the air, don't forget to retract your floats (f).

Water Bombing - Dropping:
- Approach at 200ft
- Release the water ( l )

Note that the aircraft will very quickly become 4000kg lighter, so be prepared for the change in handling.
