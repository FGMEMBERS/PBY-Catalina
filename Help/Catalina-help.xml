                =========================================
                That Model is the Catalina  PBY6 converted to be a water bomber
                It was in use in the south-east of France from 1964 to 1970
                =========================================
                Performance:
                That model is tuned ( altitude, climb and speed ) according to a payload of 10000 lbs, which is the water tank capacity filled up.
                Flying the Aircraft, without that payload, or equivalent, can  give you an unrealistic performance.
                =========================================
            START and STOP ROUTINE
            To start the engines
            =>increase magneto switch  and electric master switch "on" ( key  name "}")
            => start engines ( key   "space" or "s" of you have a recent FlightGear version)
            then take off

            To take off
            =>Unlock Brake parking  (shift B)
            =>Push the throttle to maximum
            When speed 70 knots pull the stick
            The aircraft will take off

            To stop the engines
            =>decrease magneto switch  and electric master switch "off" ( key  name "{")

            WATER BOMBER
            You mays simulate  the filling of the water tank ( 4000 liters)
            when
                =>on the water, you want the floats DOWN  (key"f")
                =>prepare the filling (command key  "L")
                => a speed minimum of 45 kts
                => push gently the elevator, just enough to keep the aircraft sliding in the water
            The filling duration time is 100 sec.
            Control your speed which must be more than 45 kts  (if less it does not fill)
            More is better.
            During the filling,  the aircraft is getting more and more heavy.
            When loaded  the weight of the aircraft is heavier of 4500 kg , remember it at take off, you wants patience, and smooth piloting.
            Before climb, you must get the maximum of speed with the help of the groundeffect, which is your friend.
            After take off, don't forget, you want the floats UP (key"f")

            Now you may simulate a water bombing
                => At a low agl, (let's say 200 ft) and over the target which is supposed to be bombed,
                => release the water (command key 'l" like "l"etter)
            The water can be seen falling down.

            The  aircraft is right now 4500 kg less , it will jump upper in the sky, be prepared for it.
            When empty don't forget to close the water tank doors ( key"D")
            You may again, go back on the sea  and fill again, that process is repeatable as long as you wish it.
